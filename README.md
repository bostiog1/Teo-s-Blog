You can see the project here: (keep in mind, this is only a prototype to help me learn)

https://66ce3fc1be29748ad5f95ade--cosmic-starburst-f9fb7a.netlify.app/ 

A Blog project where I can post, delete, update, and create. 

The main idea of the project was to practice various concepts such as: 

-state management with : 

    -Context API

    -Redux toolkit

-CRUD

-Dark Mode

-how to create a JSON Server

-error handler

-git

You can also use your own server (check the comments in the file postSlice.js) with the command from bellow

# Command for running the sever: json-server --watch src/data/db.json
